The project is an "University Management System" designed to streamline the various administrative and academic processes in universities, colleges, or schools. The system integrates multiple departments, including fee management, attendance tracking, examination handling, and faculty and student information portals, into a single platform. Developed using Java for the front-end and MySQL for the back-end, the system features a user-friendly interface to facilitate efficient data handling and process automation. The project includes modules for account management, student and teacher information, attendance tracking, subject management, marks entry, and fee payment. Each module is designed to handle specific tasks, such as student enrollment, attendance marking, and fee processing, ensuring operational efficiency and accuracy. The system also includes robust testing for functionality and user acceptance, ensuring reliability and ease of use. Overall, this project aims to enhance the efficiency of educational institutions by automating routine tasks and improving data management.
